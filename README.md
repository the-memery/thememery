# TheMemery

The Memery is a web project developed in Springboot Java for the backend API, ReactJs for the frontend, and MySQL for the database.
We started this project in Computer Science School, and we thought that it was way too fun to leave it just as a student project.

It is a digital-art gallery, and the main goal is allow artists to sell their own meme creations.

The development of the project is work-in-progress, and the formal deployment is planned for July 2023.

Have fun in the meantime :)
